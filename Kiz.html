                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>Rhinos, an important species in our ecosystem is endangered. There are only five types of rhinos left in the world. People are killing all the innocent rhinos just for their horns because they believe the horn can be made to oriental medicine that would cure many diseases which is not true at all! Drinking the medicine from the rhino horn is just like biting your nails and hair, it is made out of the exact same material. Another reason is that they would get the horn to make it  a symbol of peace and wealth, also to make dangers and accessories. 
                    </p>
					<p>Rhinos have existed on earth for 4 thousand years now, but its population has decreased by 90% since 1970. Rhinos used to live in the wild in Vietnam, however they have disappeared due to extinction. There are only around 30 thousand rhinos left in the wild all over the world. Rhinos are very important, if they disappear, a huge part of the food chain will be missing which will affect the ecosystem.
                    </p>
					<p>Overall, the population of the rhinos is decreasing very fast and they may extinct in just a few decades. This means that the next generation would look at the rhinos only in pictures and only on the internet, they will not be able to see what a rhino look like in real life even if they wanted to! When they are poaching rhinos for its horn, with the pain, the rhino could die faster. One of the ways for the rhinos to protect themselves is by the horns which are now gone. How will they keep themselves safe in the wild with all the attacks? Another reason for their extinction is their habitats are changing because of all the cities human lives in, it is taking over all the spaces for animals to live.
                    </p>
