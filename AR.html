                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Rhinos, an important species in our ecosystem is horribly endangered. There are only five species of rhinos remaining in the world. The unreasonable slaughter is for the purpose of getting its horn, a very small part of the body to sacrifice its life. However, many do not acknowledge the fact that most beliefs about the ability of the rhino horn are false. Therefore it is absolutely irrational to slaughter innocent rhinos without thinking about the consequences. Rhinos have existed on earth for approximately 4 thousand years and have decreased by 90% since 1970
                    </p>
                    <h3>Overall Population</h3>
                    <img src="http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/img/original/rhinograph_2016stats_2.jpg" alt="Rhino poaching statistic graph" style="float:left;width:300px;height:350px">
                    <p>Overall, the population of the rhinos is decreasing and is looking towards extinction in just a few decades. This means that the next generation would look at the rhinos only in pictures and only on the internet. As shown on the graph on the left, the number of rhino poaching is increasing a lot in just a few years. One of the main reasons with rhinos extinction is that the poaching is threatening the rhinos to death. With more increasement of the poachings, there were be increasing numbers of rhinos that will eventually lead to the extinction. </p>
                    <img src="https://zululandobserver.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2015/09/tj2309recovery1_19836.jpg" alt="A rhino got attacked from poachers" style="float:right;width:300px;height:200px">
                    <p>The picture on the right shows a rhino who has gotten attacked by poachers. With the pain, the rhino could die faster. One of the ways for the rhinos to protect themselves is by the horns which are now gone. How will they keep themselves safe in the wild with all the attacks? It is not only the poachings that are getting the rhinos in endanger, also the changes to their habitat is threatening them. With more industrialized places in the world, there will be less living places for rhinos and the other animals. Which is leading to a major problem of the extinction.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Rhino</h3>
                    <h4><u>Javan Rhinos</u></h4>
                    <img src="https://www.savetherhino.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Javan-Rhino-Alain-Compost-1-1-500x325.jpg" alt="A Javan rhino" style="float:left;width:300px;height:200px">
                    <p>The population of the Javan rhinos are the least populated type of rhinos that are left in the word. There are only estimated 67 Javan rhinos left in the world. Now they only live in the Ujung Kulon National Park. These rhinos are the ones that are the most vulnerable to natural disaster and diseases. Fortunately the population of the Javan rhinos are increasing over time, however, their population is still the smallest compared to other types of rhinos. This means that the Javan rhinos are in extreme danger. There are only a limited of time to increase the number and keep the rhinos alive. Since their habitat is decreasing, the number of the rhinos are also decreasing. The Ujung Kulon National Park is also in the tropical rainforest, which is where all the estimated population of Javan rhinos live in. Compared to the history, the habitat of rhinos are being developed and industrialized. Due to these factors the habitat is decreasing. </p>
                    <p>Looking more into the appearance of the Javan rhinos, the female appeared to not have the horns, which means that only the male Javan rhinos have horns. This lead to the situation that the male Javan rhinos might extinct faster than the female Javan. Since the horns of the rhinos are the valuables of the rhinos, the hunters will only seek for the male, which could lead to the faster extinction of the male Javan rhinos. 
                    The relatively close rhinos are the one horned rhinos, but javan rhinos have much smaller head and less apparent skin folds. </p>
                   
                    <h4><u>Sumatran Rhinos</u></h4>
                    <img src="https://rhinos.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SumatranRhion_Face_USE.jpg" alt="A Sumatran rhino" style="float:right;width:300px;height:170">
                    <p>Nowadays it Sumatran rhinos are barely seen. There are only approximately 80 sumatran rhinos left in the whole world. Based on the history, the poaching has lessen their population however, these days, the habitat change is their biggest threat. Humans are destructing the forest for palm oil and paper pulp. 
                    According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are only two captive female that are left for reproduction. 
                    Looking at the appearance of these types of rhinos, they are the smallest living rhinos and the only asian rhinos that has two horns. Also, they have quite a lot of long hair covering them.  
                    </p>
                     <img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/14871/images/portrait_overview/Population_Distrubution_Sumatran_Rhino.jpg?1513549680" alt="Where Sumatran rhinos live" style="width:600px;height:520px">
                    <p>Although the poaching has decreased, the sumatran rhinos are the ones that are most threatened by the  poachings. 
                    These sumatran rhinos now live in the Borna and the Sumatran. Which are both dense high and low land which is both tropical and subtropical forests. 
                    </p>
                   
                    <h4><u>Black Rhinos</u></h4>
                    <img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/1377/images/story_full_width/Black_Rhino_8.6.2012_Threats2_HI_203311.jpg?1345593202" alt="A Black rhino" style="float:right;width:300px;height:100px">
                    <p>Another type of rhinos are the Black rhinos. The population of the Black rhinos is estimated to 5,000 to 5,500.  In 1995, the population of the Black rhinos were approximately 2,100. Looking further to the history, in 1970, there were 70,000 Black rhinos that were alive in the world. From 1970 to 1995, just in 20 years, there were a decline of 96% of the Black Rhinos. More, from 1995 to now, the number of the black rhinos has increased by the efforts from the projects over Africa. The most important success that was shown by the projects were that the geographic range has also increased with the number of black rhinos increasing.  Although the population of the black rhinos have increased, there are still extreme efforts getting to them to allow the numbers of the rhinos to stay the same and/or increase. For the Black rhinos, the Wildlife crime are the main features that are stopping the rhinos to recover.</p> 
                    <img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/14869/images/portrait_overview/Population_Distribution_Black_Rhino2.jpg?1513549062" alt="Where Black rhinos live" style="width:600px;height:260px">
                    <p>Looking on the appearance they have two horns with one small posterior horn. 
                    As seen in the map, the geographic range has increased. In 1995, there were only two geographic range that the rhinos were their habitat. Comparing form then and now, there was a large different between just in 20 years. 
                    </p>
                   
                    <h4><u>Greater One Horned Rhinos</u></h4>
                    <img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/1388/images/story_full_width/Greater_One_Horned_Rhino_8.6.2012_Whytheymatter_HI_203197.jpg?1345543970" alt="A Greater One-horned rhino" style="float:left; width:370px; height:300px">
                    <p>This Greater one horned rhinos are the ones that came back from extinction. At the end of the 20th century, there were less than 200 species left in the world at the end of the 20th century. But has increased to more than 3,500 these days. India and Nepal which is the biggest habitat the the greater one horned rhinos are living in, has put in large amount of efforts and time to rise the population of the rhinos. The recovery of the Greater one horned rhinos are the biggest success that Aisa had made in the history of the rhinos recovery. 
                    The greater horned rhinos are the biggest sized among the rhinos. Moreover, there is only one horn that is at the least 8 to 25 inches long. Their skin is grey-brown hide with skin fold which gives the rhinos a armor plated appearance. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/14870/images/portrait_overview/Population_Distribution_GOH_Rhino.jpg?1513549364" alt="The geographic range of rhinos before and now" style="width:600px;height:420px">
                    <p>On the map above shows the history geographic range of the rhinos and the geographic range of rhinos now. It has decreased a lot however compared to the end of the 20th century, it has increased massively. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4><u>White Rhinos</u></h4>
                    <img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/1456/images/story_full_width/White_Rhino_8.7.2012_Threats_HI_102787.jpg?1345545643" alt="A White rhino" style="float: left; width:260px; height:200px">
                    <p>The White rhinos, another type of rhino that also came back from extinction in the early 20th century. From the population of 50-100 to about 20,000. As like it is shown in the map beneath, the majority of the white rhinos live in the Southern Africa. 
                    The name "White Rhinos" come from the word "weit" from Afrikaans a West Germanic language, which means wide and refers to the animal's mouth. Since the white rhino has a upper lip that is square-shaped. 
                    There are two genetically different subspecies existing right now. Unfortunately, there are only 2 rhinos of Northern White rhinos. The rest population is the Southern White rhinos. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/14859/images/portrait_overview/Population_Distribution_White_Rhino.jpg?1513267422" alt="The range of rhinos before and now" style="width:600px;height:520px">
                    <p>The Southern White rhinos were thought to be extinct in the late 19th century, However, in 1895, there were a small population of approximately 100 individuals discovered. The majority of the Southern White rhinos now live in protected areas and private games reserves. 
                    The poaching of the White rhinos are uncontrollable. Since the horns of the white rhinos are valuable, they only take the horns and go. Which leads to harsh condition to the rhinos to live in the wild. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rhino Horns Uses</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Rhino horn are most popular for medical use all over Asia. For the Traditional Chinese Medicine, the horns are shaved or ground into a powder and dissolved in boiling water and believed to treat fever, snake bites, headache,... and many other disorders. </li>
                    <li>It is also commonly used as a status symbol to display success and wealth. </li>
                    <li>Another cause for senselessly slaughtering the rhinos is to use for making trinkets, things like cups, daggers and accessories.</li>
                    <li>Back in the days, the horns were believed to have the ability of purify the water. Detecting poisoned liquid by causing bubbles resembling the poisonous area.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>According to studies by researchers at Ohio University using computerized tomography have proven that the horns are similar to horses’ hooves, turtle beaks and cockatoo bills. There are not many evidence to support the fact that the horns can use to cure health problems. Large doses of rhino horns extract could lower the small amount of fever in rats, this can also be done by using Saiga antelope and water buffalo horn. However, the number of horns used in the traditional Chinese medicine specialist are many times lower. Therefore, biting fingernails will be the same as using the medicine provided. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Consequences of Rhino Extinction</h3>  
                    <p>The extinction of rhino affects not only humans but also all the living creatures. Due to the extinction of rhinos, the remaining food chains will not have their pair of predator and prey. Especially to lions and vultures, they will have to deal with a great impact of losing their prey which will affect the whole food chain into an unbalanced state. Just one animal disappearing in the food chain may lead to other predators extinction too. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Moreover, according to the Scandinavian and South African researchers in the Journal of Ecology, the extinction of rhino will produce less grazable area, since grazable area were commonly found on where the rhinos used to exist on. This will reduce the number of consumers such as tree, grass, and shrub which also affect the food chain. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><u>When rhinos are extinct the entire environment will get affected and all the living creatures including human will suffer from death.   
                    </u></h4>
